# Portfolio Update Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-30

## Overview

Successfully integrated the Statistical Distributions project into the portfolio with a new standardized naming convention for organizing Jupyter notebooks by project.

## Changes Made

### 1. Notebook Naming Convention

Implemented a standardized naming pattern: `<project-prefix>-<number>-<descriptive-name>.ipynb`

**Current prefixes**:
- `dist` - Statistical Distributions (12 notebooks)
- `ht` - Hypothesis Testing (5 notebooks)

### 2. Files Added

#### Documentation
- `docs/distributions.md` - Comprehensive project overview with:
  - Feature descriptions
  - Technology stack
  - Usage examples
  - Links to all 12 notebooks
  - Unit test documentation (38 test cases)

- `docs/notebooks/README.md` - Naming convention documentation with:
  - Pattern explanation
  - Current project prefixes
  - Guidelines for adding new projects
  - Future project suggestions

#### Notebooks (12 new)
All distribution notebooks copied with `dist-` prefix:
1. `dist-01-distribution-fundamentals.ipynb`
2. `dist-02-basic-prob-and-exp-val.ipynb`
3. `dist-03-std-dev-and-var.ipynb`
4. `dist-04-data-point-to-std-dev.ipynb`
5. `dist-05-binomial-distributions.ipynb`
6. `dist-06-geometric-distributions.ipynb`
7. `dist-07-poisson.ipynb`
8. `dist-08-sample-distro-of-sample-mean.ipynb`
9. `dist-09-combinations-of-random-vars.ipynb`
10. `dist-10-transforming-random-variables.ipynb`
11. `dist-11-t-distribution.ipynb`
12. `dist-12-student-t-distribution.ipynb`

#### Test Files
- `docs/notebooks/test_datum.py` - Comprehensive unit tests (38 test cases)

### 3. Files Renamed

Existing hypothesis testing notebooks renamed with `ht-` prefix:
- `01-intro-to-pvalue.ipynb` → `ht-01-intro-to-pvalue.ipynb`
- `02-one-two-tail-test-diff-mean.ipynb` → `ht-02-one-two-tail-test-diff-mean.ipynb`
- `03-one-two-tail-test-diff-props.ipynb` → `ht-03-one-two-tail-test-diff-props.ipynb`
- `04-chi-squared.ipynb` → `ht-04-chi-squared.ipynb`
- `05-regression-hypothesis.ipynb` → `ht-05-regression-hypothesis.ipynb`

### 4. Navigation Structure Updated

Modified `mkdocs.yml` to include:

```yaml
Data Science:
  - Statistical Distributions:
    - Overview: distributions.md
    - Fundamentals: (4 notebooks)
    - Discrete Distributions: (3 notebooks)
    - Sampling and Transformations: (3 notebooks)
    - T-Distribution: (2 notebooks)
  - Hypothesis Testing:
    - Overview: hypothesis-testing.md
    - (5 notebooks with updated paths)
```

## Benefits

1. **Better Organization**: Clear project categorization
2. **Scalability**: Easy to add new projects without naming conflicts
3. **Discoverability**: Intuitive navigation structure
4. **Maintainability**: Consistent patterns across all notebooks
5. **Professional Presentation**: Comprehensive documentation for the distributions library

## Statistics

- **Total notebooks**: 17 (12 distributions + 5 hypothesis testing)
- **New documentation files**: 2
- **Test coverage**: 38 unit tests covering 5 core functions
- **Navigation levels**: 4 (with logical grouping)

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. Update older notebooks in `docs/` directory to follow naming convention
2. Add more test coverage for other functions in `datum.py`
3. Consider adding notebook metadata/descriptions
4. Add GitHub repository link to distributions.md once available
5. Generate static site with `mkdocs build` to verify all links work

## Testing Portfolio Locally

```bash
cd ~/dev/projects/portfolio
mkdocs serve
# Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

## Notes

- All original files from the distributions project remain unchanged in `~/dev/projects/distributions/`
- Legacy notebooks in `docs/` directory maintained for backward compatibility
- The naming convention is documented and ready for future project additions
- MkDocs configuration supports Jupyter notebooks via `mkdocs-jupyter` plugin
