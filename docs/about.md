# About Me

Hi, I'm Steven 👋  
I'm a Data Engineer passionate about building scalable, reliable, and governed data platforms.  
I specialize in designing data lake architectures with open table formats (Iceberg, Delta Lake, Hudi) and automating ETL pipelines on AWS.
I have recently addded AI sills with the implementation of chat boxes to the Analytic sections or my work.
