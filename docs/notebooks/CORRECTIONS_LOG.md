# Notebook Review and Corrections Log

**Date**: 2025-10-30  
**Reviewed**: All 17 notebooks (12 distributions + 5 hypothesis testing)

## Review Process

Comprehensive review conducted for:
1. **Spelling errors**
2. **Grammar issues**
3. **Factual accuracy** (mathematical formulas and statistical concepts)
4. **Consistency** in terminology

## Corrections Made

### Spelling Corrections

| Error | Correction | Notebooks Affected |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| Fundementals | Fundamentals | dist-01 |
| fundementals | fundamentals | dist-01 |
| Discreet | Discrete | dist-01 |
| discreet | discrete | dist-01 |

### Grammar Corrections

| Error | Correction | Notebooks Affected |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| it's simplest | its simplest | dist-01 |
| walk passed | walked past | dist-01 |
| people walking by | people walk by | dist-01 |
| 10 people passed | 10 people passed by | dist-01 |
| there are a fixed number | there is a fixed number | dist-05 |

### Terminology Corrections

| Error | Correction | Location | Notebooks Affected |
|-------|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| Dice Role | Dice Roll | Code and output cells | dist-01 |

## Statistical/Mathematical Accuracy

All notebooks were reviewed for factual accuracy in:

- **Probability formulas**: Verified correct notation (P(X), E(X))
- **Distribution parameters**: Confirmed μ (mu), σ (sigma) usage
- **Variance/Standard Deviation**: Verified σ² for variance, σ for std dev
- **Expected Value formulas**: Checked E(X) = Σ x·P(x) notation
- **Binomial distribution**: Verified n, p parameter usage
- **Poisson distribution**: Confirmed λ (lambda) notation
- **T-distribution**: Verified degrees of freedom (df) usage
- **Hypothesis testing**: Confirmed p-value, alpha level usage

### Verified Correct

✅ All mathematical formulas reviewed  
✅ Probability axioms (0 ≤ P(X) ≤ 1) correct  
✅ Distribution parameters properly defined  
✅ Statistical notation consistent throughout  
✅ Code implementations match theoretical formulas

## Summary Statistics

- **Total notebooks reviewed**: 17
- **Notebooks with corrections**: 2 (dist-01, dist-05)
- **Notebooks verified clean**: 15
- **Total corrections applied**: 13+ instances
- **Mathematical errors found**: 0
- **Factual inaccuracies found**: 0

## Quality Assurance

All corrections were:
1. Applied programmatically using Python scripts
2. Verified with automated checks
3. Confirmed with final manual review
4. Preserved notebook formatting and structure

## Notes

- The term "Discrete" is correct for probability distributions (not "Discreet")
- "Its" is possessive; "it's" is a contraction of "it is"
- "Dice roll" is the correct noun form (not "dice role")
- Subject-verb agreement: "there is a fixed number" (singular)
- Past tense: "walked past" not "walk passed"

## Verification Status

✅ **All notebooks verified clean and accurate**

No remaining spelling, grammar, or factual errors detected in final verification scan.
