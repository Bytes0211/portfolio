    "## One And Two Tail Test For Difference Of Mean\n",
    "<b>Introduction</b><br>\n",
    "In today's data-driven world, businesses can't rely on intuition alone to make critical decisions. Instead, they need to use statistical techniques like hypothesis testing to back up their actions with solid data. One popular test for this purpose is the t-test, which allows you to compare the means of two groups and determine whether they're statistically different.<br><br>\n",

    "While the Alternative Hypothesis will be based on the inverse of the Null Hypothesis:<br>\n",

    "The selection of tail test depends on the Hypothesis Statement written\n",
    "</span><br><br>\n",
    "In the first line of the table below you can see that if your Null Hypothesis is written with and equal statement, that means your Alternative Hypothesis will have a not equal statement, thus your test will be Two Tail. If your Null Hypothesis is written with less than or equal to, or greater than or equal to, your Alternative Hypothesis will be greater than or less than respectively, with One Tail Upper , and One Tail Lower Test. \n",

    "Another way to think about writing hypothesis statements and which tail to apply is directionality. If your hypothesis statement contains \"equals\" or \"not equals\" there is no directionality. The outcome is either equal or not. Therefore you should apply a two tail test. If your null hypothesis is \"less than\" then your alternative hypothesis is greater than, meaning pointing to the right. Then you should apply an upper tail test. If your null hypothesis is \"greater than\", then your alternative hypothesis is less than, meaning point to the left, then you you should apply a lower tail test\n",
