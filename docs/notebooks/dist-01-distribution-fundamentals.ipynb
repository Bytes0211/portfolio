    "A Random Variable in its simplest form is a function. In probability we often use random variables to represent random events. A Random Variable allows you to convert a real world experiment into a numerical value that we can perform some mathematics on. For example, we could use a random variable to represent the outcome of a die roll, being a set between 1 to 6. <br>\n",

    "* Random Variables can be either Discrete or Continuous\n",
    " * Discrete Random Variables are countable values such as the outcome of a die roll (1,2,3,4,5,6)\n",
    " * Continuous Random Variables are uncountable values such as the height of a person ( 5.6 feet, 5.67 feet, 5.678 feet etc)\n"

    "The Python wrapper provides several advantages for building a hybrid C++/Python statistical computing library:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pythonic Interface**: Matches SciPy's API (`binom.pmf(k, n, p)`) for easy adoption\n",
    "2. **Type Flexibility**: Accepts int, list, or NumPy arrays for the `k` parameter\n",
    "3. **Automatic Library Loading**: Searches common installation locations for the compiled C++ library\n",
    "4. **Error Handling**: Validates inputs and provides clear error messages\n",
    "5. **Vectorized Operations**: Efficiently processes arrays of k values\n",
    "6. **Educational Features**: Includes `format_question()` for generating readable probability statements\n",

    "#### Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) With Continuous Data\n",
    "A cumulative distribution function (CDF) describes the probabilities of a random variable having values less than or equal to x. It is a cumulative function because it sums the total likelihood up to that point. Its output always ranges between 0 and 1<br>\n",

    "CDFs have the following definition: <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "CDF function is non-decreasing. As x increases, the likelihood can either increase or stay constant, but it can't decrease<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Since no value can be lower than $-\\infty$ then if we plug $-\\infty$ into the CDF we would get $F(-\\infty) = 0$. Similarly all values will be less than $\\infty$ then if we plug in $\\infty$ into the CDF we would get $F(\\infty) = 1$<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "All this really means is the CDF will always be between 0 and 1 ($0 \\leq F(x) \\leq 1$)\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "<b>CDF vs PDF</b><br>\n",
    "Both probability density functions (PDFs) and cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) provide likelihoods for random variables. However, PDFs calculate probability densities for x, while CDFs give the chances for ≤ x<br>\n",
    "<Br>\n",
    "Put simply, the accumulated area of the PDF defines the CDF. $\\int PDF = CDF$. The CDF adds up the area of the PDF. <Br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<b>ℹ️NOTE:</b><br>\n",
    "You can use the CDF on discrete random variables as well. However it's easier to add the Probability Mass Function values to get the cumulative values of the distribution, this technique is rarely used in that fashion.<br>\n",
    "<Br>\n",
    "<span style = \"color:mediumseagreen;font-size:101%\">\n",
    "CDFs are really useful when we want to estimate the probability of an interval. \n",
    "</span><br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<b>Using Cumulative Distribution Functions</b><br>\n",
    "Cumulative distribution functions are fantastic for comparing two distributions. By comparing the CDFs of two random variables, we can see if one is more likely to be less than or equal to a specific value than the other. That helps us make decisions about whether one is more likely to have a particular property<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Additionally, these cumulative probabilities are equivalent to percentiles. A cumulative probability of 0.80 is the same as the 80th percentile. So, CDFs are great for finding percentiles<br>\n",
