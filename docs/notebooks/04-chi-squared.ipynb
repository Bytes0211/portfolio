    "\n",
    "$\\chi^2 $ Test (chi squared test) is used to investigate the relationship between categorical variables by calculating the difference between observed and expected values. Simply put, how closely related is the expected data to the actual data and is the difference statistically significant, where small $\\chi^2$ lends support to the data not being statistically significant and a large $\\chi^2$ value is statistically significant. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Types Of $\\chi^2$ Test\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three kinds of $\\chi^2$ test:\n",
    "* A $\\chi^2$ test for homogeneity\n",
    "* A $\\chi^2$ test for association/independence \n",
    "* A $\\chi^2$ test for goodness of fit \n",

    "The type of $\\chi^2$ test is determined by the type of data you have (will detail later)\n",

    "#### Conditions for $\\chi^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "* Random sample \n",
    "* Normality or Large Counts\n",
    "* Independence - Sample with replacement or sample size 10 % or less than population \n",
