- Statsmodels - Statistical modeling

## Learning Path

**Recommended Order**:
1. Start with **Introduction to P-Value** to build foundational understanding
2. Move to **One-Tail and Two-Tail Tests** to learn about directional testing
3. Explore **Chi-Squared Test** for categorical data analysis
4. Complete with **Regression Hypothesis Testing** for advanced applications

## Key Statistical Concepts

### Hypothesis Testing Framework

1. **Formulate Hypotheses**
   - Null hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ): No effect or no difference
   - Alternative hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ): Effect exists or difference exists

2. **Choose Significance Level**
   - Typically Œ± = 0.05 (5% significance level)
   - Represents probability of Type I error

3. **Calculate Test Statistic**
   - Z-statistic, t-statistic, chi-squared statistic, F-statistic
   - Depends on the type of test and data

4. **Determine P-Value**
   - Probability of observing results as extreme as actual results
   - If p-value < Œ±, reject null hypothesis

5. **Draw Conclusion**
   - Reject or fail to reject null hypothesis
   - Interpret results in context

### Common Tests Covered

| Test Type | Use Case | Notebook |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| Z-test / t-test | Compare means | #1, #2 |
| Chi-squared | Categorical relationships | #3 |
| F-test | Regression significance | #4 |
| t-test (regression) | Coefficient significance | #4 |

## Practical Applications

These notebooks demonstrate hypothesis testing in contexts such as:

- **Population Studies**: Testing differences between fish populations (cod and salmon)
- **A/B Testing**: Comparing two groups to determine statistical differences
- **Survey Analysis**: Analyzing categorical data relationships
- **Predictive Modeling**: Validating regression model assumptions

## Visual Learning

Each notebook includes:
- üìä Distribution plots showing p-value regions
- üìà Visual representations of test statistics
- üéØ Graphical interpretations of critical regions
- üìâ Regression diagnostic plots

## Prerequisites

**Required Knowledge**:
- Basic statistics (mean, variance, standard deviation)
- Understanding of probability distributions
- Familiarity with Python and Jupyter notebooks

**Setup**:
```bash
# Install required packages
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scipy statsmodels jupyter
```

## Usage

### Running Locally

```bash
# Clone or download the notebooks
cd hypothesis-testing

# Launch Jupyter
jupyter notebook

# Open any notebook to begin exploring
```

### Interactive Exploration

Each notebook is designed to be:
- **Self-contained**: Can be run independently
- **Interactive**: Modify parameters to see different outcomes
- **Educational**: Includes explanations and interpretations

## Code Examples

### Example: Basic P-Value Calculation

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy import stats

# Sample data
sample_mean = 52
population_mean = 50
std_dev = 10
n = 30

# Calculate z-score
z_score = (sample_mean - population_mean) / (std_dev / np.sqrt(n))

# Calculate p-value (two-tailed)
p_value = 2 * (1 - stats.norm.cdf(abs(z_score)))

print(f"Z-score: {z_score:.4f}")
print(f"P-value: {p_value:.4f}")
```

### Example: Chi-Squared Test

```python
import pandas as pd
from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency

# Contingency table
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'Group A': [30, 20],
    'Group B': [25, 25]
})

# Perform chi-squared test
chi2, p_value, dof, expected = chi2_contingency(data)

print(f"Chi-squared statistic: {chi2:.4f}")
print(f"P-value: {p_value:.4f}")
print(f"Degrees of freedom: {dof}")
```
