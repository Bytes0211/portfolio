# Data Science

Data science is a multidisciplinary field that combines statistics, mathematics, programming, and domain expertise to extract meaningful insights from data. It encompasses the entire data lifecycle from collection and cleaning to analysis and visualization, helping organizations make data-driven decisions. Data scientists use various tools and techniques including machine learning, statistical modeling, and data mining to solve complex problems and uncover patterns in large datasets.
