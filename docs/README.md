## Learning Path

**Recommended Order**:
1. Start with **Introduction to P-Value** to build foundational understanding
2. Move to **One-Tail and Two-Tail Tests (Means)** to learn about directional testing for means
3. Progress to **One-Tail and Two-Tail Tests (Proportions)** for categorical response variables
4. Explore **Chi-Squared Test** for testing independence in categorical data
5. Complete with **Regression Hypothesis Testing** for advanced applications

## Key Statistical Concepts

### Hypothesis Testing Framework

1. **Formulate Hypotheses**
   - Null hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ): No effect or no difference
   - Alternative hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ): Effect exists or difference exists

2. **Choose Significance Level**
   - Typically Œ± = 0.05 (5% significance level)
   - Represents probability of Type I error

3. **Calculate Test Statistic**
   - Z-statistic, t-statistic, chi-squared statistic, F-statistic
   - Depends on the type of test and data

4. **Determine P-Value**
   - Probability of observing results as extreme as actual results
   - If p-value < Œ±, reject null hypothesis

5. **Draw Conclusion**
   - Reject or fail to reject null hypothesis
   - Interpret results in context

### Common Tests Covered

| Test Type | Use Case | Notebook |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| Z-test / t-test | Compare means | #1, #2 |
| Z-test (proportions) | Compare proportions | #3 |
| Chi-squared | Categorical relationships | #4 |
| F-test | Regression significance | #5 |
| t-test (regression) | Coefficient significance | #5 |

## Practical Applications

- **Population Studies**: Testing differences between fish populations (cod and salmon)
- **A/B Testing**: Comparing two groups to determine statistical differences
- **Proportion Comparisons**: Testing differences in categorical responses (e.g., vehicle type proportions between states)
- **Survey Analysis**: Analyzing categorical data relationships
- **Predictive Modeling**: Validating regression model assumptions

## Usage

### Running Notebooks Locally

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate  # or your chosen venv name

# Launch Jupyter
jupyter notebook

# Open any notebook to begin exploring
```

### Using the Test Framework

The `create_test.py` script demonstrates how to configure and run hypothesis tests programmatically:

```python
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, '..')
from resources import test, datum

# Configure test parameters
test_params = {
    'cl': 0.95,              # Confidence level
    'type': 'prop',          # Test type: 'prop', 'mean', etc.
    'tail': 'lower',         # 'lower', 'upper', or 'two'
    'n1': 100,               # Sample size
    'p1': 0.30,              # Sample proportion
    'null_hypo': 'H‚ÇÄ description',
    'alt_hypo': 'H‚ÇÅ description',
    'visual': True           # Generate visualizations
}

# Run the test
test_obj = test.Test()
test_obj.make_hypothesis_test(info=test_params)
```
