## 🚀 Featured Projects

All of these projects that have been added in the last month originally resided in AWS CodeCommit. I decided to migrate to GitHub and do some cleanup along the way. It's been a lot of "Now how does that work?", "What the heck is that?", and "That's stupid!", but it's been kinda fun experience.
